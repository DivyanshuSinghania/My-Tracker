## DSA

### Arrays
- Questions majorly from Leetcode, ques number specified in the file Name 000_QuesName.cpp

### Binary-Search
- Same as Arrays

### Greedy Algorithms
- Here there are some questions that are just famous for beginers but not present in leetcode
- Other than that i explained the ques before too in the code with comments
- some leetcode ques have optimal solution with dynamic programming so didnt submit the greedy algo approch solution


Note: Every Ques is picked from DSA A-Z sheet by strivers, link: [here](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2/)
